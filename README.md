# gzn.zsh-theme

This is a fork from [daivasmara](https://github.com/Daivasmara/daivasmara.zsh-theme) theme.

* Colors: [Ayu color theme from kitty terminal emulator](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes?tab=readme-ov-file#ayu).
* Font: [Anonymous Pro for Powerline Bold - 14pt](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

**NOTE:** These are the colors and font that I'm using. You don't necessarily need to set these up, you only need to if you want the looks to be exactly like the gif above.
